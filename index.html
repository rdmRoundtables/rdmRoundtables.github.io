    <h3><a name="speakers">About our speakers</a></h3>
        <p><strong>Allison Levy</strong> is Digital Scholarship Editor, as part of Brown University’s digital monograph publishing initiative generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Allison fulfills roles in bringing together key technological, organizational, and academic resources across the campus to generate a broader, more effective structure within the University to support the creation, cultivation, evaluation, dissemination, and preservation of new forms of faculty-driven digital scholarly projects intended for publication. An art historian, Allison earned her Ph.D. in History of Art from Bryn Mawr College and has held academic appointments at University College London, Wheaton College (Massachusetts), and Tulane University. She has authored or edited four scholarly books on the visual and material culture of early modern Italy, and her first work of narrative nonfiction will be published in December 2018. Allison also serves as General Editor of Visual and Material Culture, 1300-1700, an interdisciplinary book series published by Amsterdam University Press.

    <p><strong>Tara Nummedal </strong> is Associate Professor in the History Department. After earning her Ph.D. in History from Stanford she authored her first book, Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire. She recently completed the manuscript of her second book, The Lion’s Blood: Alchemy, Gender, and Apocalypse in Reformation Germany. Working with Donna Bilak and staff in the Brown University Library, she is working on a digital project based on a musical alchemical emblem book, Michael Maier's Atalanta fugiens (1618). Her work has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Chemical Heritage Foundation, and, most recently, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. She is Past President of the New England Renaissance Conference and a member of the editorial board of the journal Ambix. She teaches courses in early modern European history and the history of science.
